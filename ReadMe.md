# Learning 6502

This is a repository in which I have made some projects in 6502 assembly with the help of this [tutorial](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/).

Some other sources I used are

* [6502 opcodes](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html)
* [6502 wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Example_code)
